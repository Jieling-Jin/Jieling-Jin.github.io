permalink: /publication/2024-04-01-paper-title-number-5
excerpt: 'The dynamic characteristics of vehicles involved in crashes may be an important factor affecting the crash severity. This study investigates the relationship between the dynamic characteristics of vehicles involved in crashes in the five seconds before the occurrence and the crash severity. The findings aim to offer insights for preventing severe crashes and advancing autonomous vehicle technology.'

The dynamic characteristics of vehicles involved in crashes may be an important factor affecting the crash severity. This study investigates the relationship between the dynamic characteristics of vehicles involved in crashes in the five seconds before the occurrence and the crash severity. The findings aim to offer insights for preventing severe crashes and advancing autonomous vehicle technology.
